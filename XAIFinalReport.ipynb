    "\n",
    "The disagreement problem, as highlighted in the Kaur et al. (2020) paper, emphasizes the challenge of interpreting conflicting feature importances provided by different explanation tools and methods. This issue is particularly relevant in the context of dashboarding and explanation tools, where users often struggle to cope with varying explanation styles and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project focuses on addressing this problem by designing a dashboard tailored for data science students. The dashboard aims to help users understand the features that contribute to housing price predictions by allowing them to compare 2 or 3 different explanation methods side-by-side. This comparison will provide insights into how these methods differ and how users can effectively interpret them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relevance of this tool becomes even more apparent when considering the housing market in the Netherlands, where finding affordable housing is a significant challenge. A tool that explains housing price predictions in an accessible and transparent way could be invaluable for understanding the factors driving these prices, enabling better decision-making for both students and professionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we conducted user research and pilot testing using standard dashboarding tools. Based on the findings, we designed a prototype dashboard that aligns with the needs of our target audience. The datasets used for this project are sourced from the course materials or other relevant projects.\n",

    "We utilized various explanation methods introduced during the initial lectures and explored through the notebooks provided by the lecturers, including SHAP, LIME, Integrated Gradients, SmoothGrad, and GradientShap. These notebooks not only helped us understand the theoretical aspects of these methods but also demonstrated their practical applicability, showing that we could effectively use these techniques to address the housing problem in the Netherlands. Each of these methods offers unique approaches to understanding feature importance and model interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a game-theoretic approach that assigns importance values to features by considering all possible feature combinations, ensuring consistency and fairness in feature attribution. LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) explains individual predictions by approximating the model locally with an interpretable surrogate model, such as linear regression. Integrated Gradients is a gradient-based method that computes feature attributions by integrating the gradients of the model's output with respect to the input along a path from a baseline to the actual input. SmoothGrad enhances gradient-based methods by reducing noise through averaging gradients over multiple noisy samples of the input, resulting in smoother and more interpretable explanations. GradientShap, a variant of Integrated Gradients, combines the baseline approach with random sampling and averages the attributions over multiple baselines to improve robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to reviewing and testing these methods, we conducted a brief user research study with data science students to assess whether they perceive value in such a dashboard. The feedback from this research validated the idea, as students expressed that a tool enabling the comparison of different explanation methods would be highly beneficial for understanding and interpreting model predictions. This validation further reinforced the relevance of our project and guided the design of the prototype dashboard.\n",
